Shipping & Returns
We offer delivery of your smart swimsuit with the option to try it on, allowing you to choose from several models and sizes to find the one you like best (or even purchase more than one). This type of delivery is available once a week for various locations across Montenegro. Our manager will confirm your order and discuss the delivery date with you.
