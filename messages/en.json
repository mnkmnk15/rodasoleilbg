    "tanSpeed": {
      "question": "How fast will you get tan?",
      "answer": "The speed and intensity of your tan in a smart swimsuit depend on various factors, with the main one being the melanin content in your skin. For the areas not covered by the swimsuit, we recommend using a higher SPF sunscreen (up to 50) in the first few days of sun exposure to allow your body to acclimate to the sun, especially if some areas have never tanned before. In rare cases, it may take longer than usual for the tan to even out."
    },
    "transparent": {
      "question": "Are swimsuits transparent?",
      "answer": "No, smart swimsuits are almost not transparent. They are designed to be nearly opaque due to the density of the fabric and carefully chosen prints. However, the fabric itself is relatively thin because of the presence of numerous tiny pores that allow sunlight to pass through."
    },
    "serviceLife": {
      "question": "What is the service life of swimsuits?",
      "answer": "The service life of any swimsuit, including ours, directly depends on proper care. Formally, swimsuits are designed for one season of use, but our products can easily last for 2 or 3 seasons and continue to bring joy to their owners. Even the most expensive and high-quality models, when exposed to external factors and UV protection..."
